Dynamic Product Filter – Description
1. HTML (Experiment-5.html)

Purpose
The HTML file builds the basic structure of the product filtering web page.

Key Components

Container: Holds the page title, filter dropdown, and product list.

Title Section: Displays “Available Products” as the heading.

Filter Controls: Provides a dropdown menu to filter products by category (All, Clothing, Electronics, Books).

Product List: Displays products inside list items. Each product is assigned a category using the data-category attribute for filtering.

2. CSS (Experiment-5.css)

Purpose
The CSS file styles the page to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Key Styling Points

Adds borders, padding, background color, and rounded corners to the main container.

Customizes title size and color for better visibility.

Aligns the label and dropdown neatly using spacing and flex layout.

Removes default bullet points from the list.

Styles each product item with background color, border, padding, and hover effects to enhance user experience.

3. JavaScript (Experiment-5.js)

Purpose
The JavaScript file adds interactivity to dynamically filter products based on the selected category.

Process

Waits for the webpage to load completely before executing the filtering logic.

Selects the dropdown menu and product items from the page.

Defines a filtering function that:

Reads the selected category.

Displays all products if “All” is selected.

Displays only matching products for other categories.

Hides the rest.

Attaches an event listener to trigger filtering whenever the dropdown selection changes.

Runs the filter function once on page load to show all products by default.

Overall Working

HTML creates the page layout and product list.

CSS styles the page for a neat appearance.

JavaScript filters products dynamically without reloading the page.
